# Security Policy
As it currently stands, Mainframe is not being used in a serious context. Security bugs should just be reported like a normal issue. If Mainframe, or a derivation of it, were to be actually used for a wiki of some type, than this security policy will be changed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Open up a PR or a issue on this repository, and set the title to begin with `SECURITY:`.
