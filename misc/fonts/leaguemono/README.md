League Mono
===========

_by [Tyler Finck](https://www.tylerfinck.com)_

**Monospace/variable font fun.**

League Mono is a mashup of sorts, inspired by some beautiful forms found in both Fira Mono, Libertinus Mono, and Courier(?!).


May 2018 update: League Mono has been made a variable font:
![League Mono Variable A and B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sursly/leaguemono/master/imgs/variable-A-B.png)

Use the one TTF file called `LeagueMonoVariable.ttf` for 40 predefined styles of League Mono. Then tweak the weight or width (from condensed – 50 – to extended – 200 - with various weights - 100 through 800).

Play with it at [tylerfinck.com/leaguemonovariable](https://tylerfinck.com/leaguemonovariable/)


Or you can use the OTF / TTF styles (above) for individual weights/widths if you don’t want to deal with the Variable version just yet. I made a cheat sheet:
